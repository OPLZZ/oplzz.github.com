      <h2>Extended Project Description</h2>

      <h2>Executive summary</h1>
        
      <p>
        The goal of the project is to increase employment opportunities for people disadvantaged in the job market. Unemployment as a social phenomenon contributes to the deepening economic crisis. The increase in size of the long-term unemployment risk groups (graduates, women returning from parental leave, people over fifty and many others) is alarming. This project aims to address this problem by creating a new platform, which will enable direct connection between jobs seekers and employers, especially in the case of short-term jobs that are tied to a specific location. Such feature may be offered by a web application accessible through smart phones. The job-matching application will be developed in close cooperation with international partners to allow the transfer of valuable know-how into the conditions of the Czech Republic.
      </p>
        
      <h2>Background</h1>
      <p>
        Current unemployment level in the EU fluctuates around 10% on average (with local negative divergences which include countries most threatened by the ongoing crisis). This situation has been basically constant for several years now. Unemployment as a social phenomenon contributes to the deepening economic crisis and strongly effects younger generation the most. Other social groups are endangered by this phenomenon as well. Long term and ongoing rise of unemployment level among risk groups (graduates, women returning from maternity leave, people over fifty and many others) is very alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The longer is an unemployed person looking for work, the more one’s expectations decrease and frustration grows. Social ties gradually decline and thus the chances of getting a job are diminishing.  As a result, long-term unemployed person looses well-fare benefits and thus experiences the need for immediate cash at the cost of abandoning the original intent and interest, but by doing this also drops out of sight of classic recruitment agencies. This creates an effect not unlike a long tail, which is not covered by any employment or recruitment agency or any other intermediaries or tools. 
      </p>

      <div class='page_break'></div>
      <h2>Aims of the project</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key possible solutions would be to create a new platform, which would allow direct connection between job seekers and potential employers, especially for short-term employment at a specific location. Smart phones and tablets with GPS applications are ideal tools for such solution. It would be a completely new tool to address unemployment – a tool that has never been developed or tested in Czech conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project will involve a minimum of 180 people from groups targeted by incentive: active job seekers, young adults, people over 50, long-term unemployed women, women and men returning to work after parental leave and employers. Outputs of the project will be disseminated through 6 workshops and a 2-day conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from the main goal, which is to create a pilot version of the job-matching application, the project will bring:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>methodology for creating ontologies</li>
        <li>final ontology</li>
        <li>specifications of micro-formats</li>
        <li>conference proceedings</li>
        <li>web portal</li>
        <li>the application's guide</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All project outputs will be used not only for immediate activities, but also for its further sustainability for at least 5 years.
      </p>

      <h2>Partners</h2>
      <p>
        The project is implemented in close collaboration with two international partners, world leaders in the field of linked data and ontology. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first partner is the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) at the National University of Ireland in Galway. DERI is a web science research institute primarily specialized on semantic web and linked data. Members of the institute work on a number of Web standards in this area, including contributions to the W3C standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second project partner is Dutch Tilburg School of Economics and Management, Department of Information Management, which is based at the University of Tilburg. The research conducted at the department specializes on the fields of social sciences, economics and business. The conceptual modelling established at the department and the ontological approach for capturing the domain knowledge is in line with the aims of the project to represent the supply and demand on job markets.
